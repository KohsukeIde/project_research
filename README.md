# Tennis Form Optimization using 3D Pose Estimation
## Introduction
In the world of tennis, achieving an ideal form is both an art and a science. While the theoretical understanding of the perfect swing or serve exists, attaining it is often elusive. The challenges are more pronounced for beginners, who grapple with the nuances of form, and for those returning from breaks, who might forget their previously acquired skills.

This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging 3D pose estimation to provide insights and corrective feedback on one's tennis form, specifically focusing on the forehand.

## Why This Project?
1. Complexity of Ideal Form: The intricacies of tennis make it challenging to theoretically determine an ideal form. This project provides a practical solution by analyzing real-world forms and suggesting improvements.
2. Memory Gaps: Players returning from breaks often struggle to recall their previous form. Our solution offers them a mirror to their past, helping in quick recalibration.
3. Beginners' Dilemma: Novices find it hard to grasp the correct tennis form. Our tool serves as a guide, simplifying their journey from amateur to pro.

Input/output
- **Input**: Key points from the 3D pose estimation of a forehand shot.
- **Output**: Corrected key points data, suggesting an optimized form.
The model harnesses the data obtained from 3D pose estimation (MeTRAbs[https://github.com/isarandi/metrabs]) to generate this output, effectively acting as a bridge between raw form and its ideal version.
